Viewer Management Process
=========================

This is the updater process that is launched for the Second Life
Viewer (https://github.com/secondlife/viewer).

If you want to support both 32 and 64 bit Windows, you'll need to build this
with a 32 bit Python interpreter and use the resulting .exe for both.
